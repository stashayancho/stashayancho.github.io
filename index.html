<h3 id="dollar-ducky">Dollar Ducky</h3>

<p><a href="http://dollarducky.herokuapp.com">Dollar Ducky</a> is a personal finance app that will help you get all your financial ducks in a row. It offers spending overviews, bill tracking, budgeting, purchase planning, a financial decision calculator, and a chatbot built with the Twilio API that you can text for information about any of the above. It integrates with the Plaid API to pull transaction information from your bank. Built in 2 weeks by a team of 3. If you&rsquo;d like to try it out with the link above, please make sure to use the sandbox credentials provided when linking a bank. Click on the photo below to see a video of our presentation.</p>

<h3 id="musicmates">MusicMates</h3>

<p><a href="https://musicmates-stackathon.herokuapp.com">Music Mates</a> integrates with your Spotify account in order to compare your music tastes with those of a friend. Entering another user&rsquo;s Spotify ID will display a radar graph of a comparison of your favorite genres. Because of the nature of Spotify&rsquo;s API, there&rsquo;s no direct way to extract genres from a user&rsquo;s playlist, meaning I had to make thousands of API calls to gather my data. This project taught me so much about APIs, rate limiting, throttling, and the value of caching. Built in about 3 days.</p>

<p>TECH: JS, Spotify API, React, Redux, Express, Node, PostgreSQL, Sequelize, Material UI</p>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t always know I wanted to be a software developer. Many people in this field seem to have been computer nerds since they were kids, whereas I always preferred analog puzzles. I carried puzzle books with me everywhere I went and got to college thinking I&rsquo;d become a cryptologist. That dream didn&rsquo;t survive freshman-year linear algebra, and unfortunately I was unaware at the time just how similar computer programming is to what I wanted to do. Instead I turned to international relations and Russian language, and after graduation I moved to Russia to teach English. My time in Russia taught me the true meaning of tenacity and also led me to discover my passion for coding. I love the fact that the puzzles I solve now have a reward at the end &ndash; bringing to life an idea.</p>
